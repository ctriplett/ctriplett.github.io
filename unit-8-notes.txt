@media screen only and (min-width: 500px) {
body {
font-size: 12px;
}

In the example, we are telling the browser that's loading our page, “If the maximum width of the browser is larger than 500 pixels, change the font-size of the body to 12 pixels.”


@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) { font-size: 14px; }

For browser widths between 320px and 480px, load the font at 14px.

Unit 8, quiz Q8: the class is ".articles", not ".article", so technically, none of the answers is correct.
